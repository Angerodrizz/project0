# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my first website, on the index or landing page it has a navigation bar with 5 buttons (home, about me, hobbies, interests, goals), then you would find the header with a short text and two sections that would link you to the buttons and you can fifnally find the footer.
